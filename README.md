he primary focus of this assignment was on implementing the core functional requirements:

- RESTful API design
- Server-side pagination
- Server-side filtering and sorting
- Search functionality
- Proper database querying and indexing
- Clean component structure and state management

UI styling was intentionally kept minimal to prioritize functionality, scalability, and clean architecture within the given time constraints.

With more time, the UI can be enhanced using a component library (e.g., Material UI) and improved visual design patterns.
